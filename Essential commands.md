# Essential Git Commands
## git clone [url]: 
    Clone (download) a repository that already exists on some Source Code Management System, including all of the files, branches, and commits.
## git status: 
    This command shows you what branch you're on, what files are in the working or staging directory, and any other important information.
## git remote -v: 
    This shows the associated remote repositories and their stored name, like origin.
## git remote add origin <url>: 
    Adds a remote so one can collaborate with others on a newly initialized repository.
## git push: 
    Uploads all local branch commits to the remote.
## git push -u origin master: 
    When pushing a branch for the first time, this type of push will configure the relationship between the remote and your local repository so that you can use git pull and git push with no additional options in the future.
