# Overview
-   Git has three states, that the files can reside in:
    - **Modified**: means that the file has changed but it has not been committed to the database yet.
    - **Staged**: means that one has marked a modified file in its current version to go into the next commit snapshot.
    - **Committed**: means that the data is safely stored in the local database.
